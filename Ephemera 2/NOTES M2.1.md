What does this imply for history? (inquiry into the cause of things)
Frameworks 
Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga
- It discusses the importance of the play element of culture and society.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens#cite_note-GrabowSpreckelmeyer2014-4) Huizinga suggests that play is primary to and a necessary (though not sufficient) condition of the generation of culture. The Latin word _ludens_ is the present active participle of the verb _ludere_, which itself is cognate with the noun _ludus_. _Ludus_ has no direct equivalent in English, as it simultaneously refers to sport, play, school, and practice.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens#cite_note-5)
1.  Play is free, is in fact [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom "Freedom").
2.  Play is not "ordinary" or "real" life.
3.  Play is distinct from "ordinary" life both as to locality and duration.
4.  Play creates order, is order. Play demands order absolute and supreme.
5.  Play is connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained from it.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens#cite_note-10)
- PLAY - otherwordly realms of human experience
-Instrumental IN teaching children, burning out energy 
- THE MAGIC CIRCLE - play happens inside: players take new roles, diff rules, action; consequences stay within circle 
Bounded space, own set of rules 
CRITICS - actiosn inside the circle do have an impact on life 

- Caillois disputed Huizinga's emphasis on competition in play. He also noted the considerable difficulty in arriving at a comprehensive definition of play, concluding that play is best described by six core characteristics:

-   1. it is free, or not obligatory
-   2. it is separate from the routine of life, occupying its own time and space
-   3. it is uncertain, so that the results of play cannot be pre-determined and the player's initiative is involved
-   4. it is unproductive in that it creates no wealth, and ends as it begins economically speaking
-   5. it is governed by rules that suspend ordinary laws and behaviours and that must be followed by players
-   6. it involves imagined realities that may be set against 'real life'.

Bernard Suits 
Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.

**INVERSION OF MEANS AND ENDS**

Narratology vs Ludology (stories are not just stories, games are simulations, special - rules)
 
- Story - chronology of events 
- discourse - the order inw hich those events emerge in the telling 

FICTION THEORY 
Games - self involving interactive fictions 
events of the game are as true to the player as they are for the in-game avatar

HENRY JENKINS - 
Narratives aren't sequence of events, sequence of spaces 

IAN BIGOST - 
Games are simulations. simulations aim for understanding

JESPER JUUL -
Games are half real 
winning/losing are the real thing 

ART? Computer-mediated play 
art aesthetics 
Computer has own agency 
Unfinished art 

THE BUBBLE - JAAKO STENRO, reimagining the magic circle 
"the arena"

SPORT? 
Games are a variation of a social contract
Are these rules sensible and allow me to finish the goal? 
Performative 
demonstration of mastery of historical thinking - historical game 
spectators aesthetic experience 

What does it mean to play history? 
Nguyen - develop an idea that games are an art form and their expressive medium is painting with agency
