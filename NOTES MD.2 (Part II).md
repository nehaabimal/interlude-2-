- the historical problem space (HPS) framework
- all historical games present the past in terms of player agents with roles and goals that are contextualized within a virtual gameworld whose features enable and constrain player action
- strategies and makes choices
- history is an interpretation, not a fixed record.
- This process of selection, assembly, and presentation … means that the history that emerges would depend on: (1) Which facts are chosen, and (2) how they are put together again." (Kapell & Elliott, p. 5)
- he best parallel for studying and appreciating a younger-than-text historical medium comes from studies of historical film.
- -   A primary _player agent_ representing some form of historical actor tasked with one or more designer-made _goals_, ultimately expressed as victory conditions, operating within
- -   a _virtual gameworld_, a simulated world that usually refers to specific historical locations and contains the game components, essentially the game system, within an environment and geography that includes
- -   various _gameworld elements: agents_, _minions, resources, obstacles,_ and _tools_, whose function primarily is to enable and/or constrain the player agent in achieving those designed goals;

-   and so, the player forms _strategies_, makes _choices_, and adopts _behaviors_ to reach those designed goals, optimally by capitalizing on abilities and circumventing, overcoming, or working within the constraints in the game's virtual space.
- **why** a particular gamic history represents the past the way it does (Kapell & Elliott 2013)

- HPS - It is a dynamic analysis influenced by systems theory in that it focuses on a working system stemming from designers' goals for player choice and action within a closed system, the gameworld
- how did the developers employ their skills and talents in the medium to communicate the past in a gamic history?"
- -   How do the systems and components of a videogame history function together to provide the player with a historical problem space?

-   How do the design choices of the system and space influence this or that component and how it presents history?

-   Why do the components in the historical gameworld function as they do, and what kinds of historical messages does their functioning promote?

-   What is the function of components in the overall game-space system that are not consistent with historical evidence, and how do the design choices, including genre choices, of the designers emphasize certain ways of portraying the past?
- -   Does the gamic problem space reasonably reflect the historical evidence and record about historical actors, their contexts, and their actions?
- "consistent with the historical record / historical evidence."/"consistent with critically used evidence," vs historically accurate 

A historical game has to begin at a clear point in real world history and that history has to have a manifest effect on the nature of the game experience"

GAME SPACES 
_Explorable_ game spaces are those that are hidden from the player and meant to be explored
_Traversable game spaces_ are those where the player-agent can move from place to place, generally navigating obstacles as they go;
 _Contested__game spaces_ allow the player or rival agents to control parts of the space by occupying or otherwise limiting rivals' access to parts or all of it as in wargames, strategy and grand strategy games.
 _Developable_ game spaces exist where the player-agent develops the space, constructing cities or buildings, for example, extracting resources, changing terrain


- capitalism, colonialism, white supremacy, patriarchy, caste supremacy and so on — are reproduced through the formal techniques and themes of game design
-  imperial mode of spectacle and alienation, geopolitical instability, global inequalities and accelerating ecological crisis
- The ideologies of dominant culture shape what players expect, what is considered viable and valuable, which is to say what is funded, made and distributed, what is expected of us as designers and workers and as humans.
- C Thi Nguyen talks about [games as a medium of agency](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190052089.001.0001/oso-9780190052089). Game design tells players who to be and what to do.
- _Writers have long had a language for how whiteness warps the imagination._ [_James Baldwin_](https://time.com/5859214/james-baldwin-racism/) _used a vivid metaphor to describe the sensation: the “little white man” who hovers nearby and passes judgment on everything you write. I prefer this to the more polite contemporary euphemism, the “white gaze,” which sounds like it has an off-switch and ignores the way it can get inside you. The “little white man,” by contrast, sounds like he climbs up your back and breathes down your neck and farts in your ear. He demands that you explain yourself and your people according to specific scripts; cries foul when you describe what it’s like to live in your body; when you turn a nice phrase, probably hisses something like “but you’re so articulate.”_
- The white player is a vortex that distorts our art and practice
- The white player is also a projection of the white designer’s anxieties, fears, repressions, desires and instincts. The white player justifies the white designer’s own preferences, which are then normalised and replicated. Other possibilities are shut down. The white designer maintains their own power in the hierarchy of the studio through this “special communion”, this “unique ability to understand” the white player.
- “Player-centric design” is plagued by unexamined whiteness,
-  anxiousness to “give the player what he wants”, in the sense of the ritual mantra “the customer is always right”
- driven by a desire to seize back the histories and fantasies of non-white and colonised people
- “If you’re going to build a creative practice out of denying somebody’s expectations, you still have to spend a lot of time anticipating their desires.”
- idea of meritocracy, which is part of the propaganda of whiteness. The gamer who is winning in the game which presents itself as meritocratic, sees any accommodations made for other players as unfairly advantaging them and devaluing their own achievement.
- Broadening a game’s ability to “read” and reward a broader range of play styles, capabilities and players, is deeply threatening to the myth of meritocracy which relies on the idea that only one type of play, or a certain set of abilities — that just happen to accrue to a certain type of player, say young white middle class able-bodied Anglo-American men — are the only legitimate types of play within the system.
-  The game is thus a forum for the white player to “prove” “objectively” the innate superiority of whiteness,
- “dominator culture”, where hierarchy and power are rigidly enforced through fear and force, and domination is valorised and normalised.
- Games where enemies are killed, subjugated, displaced, where we design juicy feedback to enhance the sadistic thrill of maiming our opponents, god games, turn-based military simulations, even farming games where the player dominates and brings to productive order the landscape, 4X games, many strategy games. On the thematic level, games that are _about_ conquest, war, overcoming enemies through violence, overthrowing nations, becoming king / boss / tycoon, or even achieving mastery over the game’s systems.
- “acts of psychic self-mutilation” that males are called on to perform in dominator culture, that they must “kill off the emotional parts of themselves”
- Game design in the imperial mode tends toward addictive, coercive and exploitative pleasures — abusive design which does not respect the player’s human needs, and in fact leverages those needs for its own purposes.

**Lecture Notes**

- Jeremiah McCall - history is "curated representation of past", historical medium with affordances and constraints
- Historian-designer} selects sources, curation (choice - intersectionality) 
- Value proposition behind choices 
- choices-reasons-effects
- Games are systems (closed set, mathematically define, function with player input)
- Complex (can't be described as the sum of the parts , the whole is greater, reaction from individual interactions) 
VS 
- complicated systems (many subsystems, single point of failure, systems understood by their parts)
- Gameworld is within the genre 
- Form shapes content 
- Historically Meaningful Game Design - how much it contributes to our prioritised historical discourses 
- GENRE 
- Imperial Design - California 80s and 70s, white male video game designers
