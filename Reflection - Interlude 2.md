In reflecting upon Module 2 and concept of Playfullness or Playful Engagement, I want to first analyze my Unessay in the context of the Jeremiah McCall's Historical Problem Space framework, especially considering that my Twine story on "Decolonization of Museums and Repatriation of Indigenous Artefacts in Canada" is historical-based and interactive, but not necessarily a part of a "game world" but does include historical time periods. I related with the Dream of Darkness developer journal which revealed that the HPS is usually applied to strategy/simulation games and my Twine is a single-player story-driven adventure game where the problem spaces are developed through narrative storytelling and descriptions. The only behaviour that the player agent must display is curiousity and a willingness to learn. 
My game, like Dream of Darkness, intends to be a ‘realist-simulation’ style that sticks true to historical events and is supposed to engage audiences unfamiliar with the trials and triumphs of repatriation, an expensive process that has been ongoing for years.

When we analyzed 'Nothing Besides Remains,' the objective was clear: to find out what happened in a deserted, ruined, unidentified village through contextual clues like natural features 
and surrounding architecture. My objectives are not so clear. 

The player agent in my Twine story is a history major with an interest in Indigenous history in Canada. The primary goal is to explore three different museums in Canada: the Aanischaaukamikw Cree Cultural Institute, the Canadian Museum of History and the Killarney Centennial Museum. The secondary goal is for the player to recognize the disctinctions, especially in scale, between these three museums and the role Indigenous narratives play in each of them. The first is an award-winning Indigenous museum focusing on the history of the James Bay Crees. The second is Canada's national museum of human history and features a Grand History Hall that covers the history of  **the** First Peoples of **Canada’s** Pacific Coast. The third and final option is an Anishanaabe community-run museum in Shebahonaning, now known as the village of Killarney. I am doing investigative research that reveals that archeologists from the University of Michigan excavated Indigenous artefacts (beads and arrowheads, etc) from Killarney in the 1950s and the University has refused requests for repatriation of these items from their collections. I want the player to follow along with my ongoing research, see the catalogue of stolen artefacts, and learn about the repatriation process. This would be a secondary goal within my Twine story and allows exploration and problem analysis by the player.  The other agents in the game would be museum guides/curators, directors and academics that I have interviewed and who's knowledge of repatriation/rematriation and the signifigance of preserving artefacts is the foundation of the story/gameplay. 

One of the main questions of the HPS framework, as referenced by McCall in "The Historical Problem Space Framework: Games as a Historical Medium," is "How do the design choices of the system and space influence this or that component and how it presents history?" By incorporating visuals through linking Mural and hyperlinking images into my Twine story, I hope to present an accurate representation of the museums the player will be visiting. This is a visual narrative and I want players to be able to see digital versions of the artefacts and the museum collections. As this is part of my journalistic research, I agree with McCall that it my Twine game will aim to be "consistent with the historical record/ historical evidence," rather than just historically accurate, and the arrowheads, beads, and totem poles are all historical evidence. I also want to include excerpts from my interviews and powerful quotes in my Twine story to keep the player engaged and invested in learning more. Because I am directly discussing archeology and heritage, this related to generating 'enchantment,' as discussed in "The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record" by Sara Perry. 

In discussing decolonization of museums which are essentially at their core, colonial projects, I have to reflect on Meghana Jayanth's keynote talk on "Game Design in the Imperial Mode," espeically considering that my Unessay is attempting to be in antimperialist mode and anti-"dominator culture". My Unessay is challenging because I am not Indigenous and I have to remain respectful and accurate in representation of Indigenous history. In Jayanth's words, I "must act as a “moral corrective” to the distorted representations and stereotypes" of Indigenous culture, which has faced its share of "invisibility and media distortion in the past," especially since I am also including AI generated images. It is a narrative that is sensitive, especially since any discussion of repatriation must also include human remains held in museum collections. I hope that my Twine story and narratve design reflects the following: "agency, consent, respect, autonomy — facing and in some way resolving our own deeply imprinted misconceptions." In this sense, I am also hoping to reflect the role of games (or narrative storytelling-type games) as a "communicative artifacts" and a form of "agency" for the player because I offer choices  and unrestrictive play. In this way, according to C. Thi Nguyen's "Games Agency as Art," I am playing history.

The article directly addresses one of the main problems in the repatriation process - the concept of preservation (the "preservation paradigm’ and ‘conservation ethos"). In most Indigenous cultures, artefacts are meant to be used upon their creation and let to nature, rather than salvaged and preserved for museum collections. Museums reconcile this by working with First Nation communities to repatriate their artefacts and/or preserve with the intent of telling Indigenous stories and sharing untold history. It will be interesting to see the clash between Indigenous mindsets and the goal of archeologists to archive the past and store it for future generations. However, museum collections and exhibitions showcasing Indigenous history can inspire social conversations on "complex, controversial topicsin museum contexts." Museums, like heritage sites, have the power to ‘enchant’ and "inspire human generosity, ethical mindfulness, and care for the world," especially in regard to Indigenous issues which are mostly overlooked by society. I hope to tackle the question of "to preserve or not to preserve" in my Twine story.
